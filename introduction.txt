Ansible is a task execution engine that targets both the local system and remote systems.

Benefits - Simple
         - Minimal
         - Easy to use
         - Easy to learn
         - Written in Python
         - Flexible
         - Automation (Manual server management by siloed server admins before Ansible existed)
         - Free and open-source
         - Original goals
             - Clear
             - Fast
             - Complete
             - Efficient
             - Secure
         - Human audits (Playbooks [YAML] and Inventory logs are human-readable files)
         - Scalable (Small to large environments)
         - Extensibility (Leverage modules for straightforward functionality)
         - Plugins to give additional capability
         - Dynamic inventories
         - Agentless (Clientless [SSH] architecture, No need to go to the remote systems and install client software to control them)
         - State driven
         - Idempotent
         - Easy to modify scripts


When running Ansible on a system to control other systems, the local system is known as the "Control Node".

"Role" is a downloadable component that can be installed and executed in the Ansible system/environment which is needed for automation and orchestrations.
Role is a way to package everything up that would be needed and distribute it and then plug it right in to Ansible.

Usages - Remote management
         Automation and orchestration
            - Automation refers to a single task
            - Orchestration refers to the management of many automated tasks (Often a complicated ordering with dependencies)
         System configuration management
         React to configuration changes
         Infrastructure management
            - Build infrastructure from the ground up
            - Manage physical infrastructure
            - Automate virtualization
            - Wide operating system support
         Repeating tasks across fleets
            - Running ad-hoc tasks (No playbook is needed)
            - Strategies and Forks
